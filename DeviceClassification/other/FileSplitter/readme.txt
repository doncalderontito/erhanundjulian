FileSplitter solves 2 different problems:
	1.If trace is longer than one day it will cut it into serveral files.
	2.Sometimes a day is duplicated and appended at the end of the file. It will erase the duplication.

Important:	
First you should try to use this application on copy of the data, because it will change the input.
